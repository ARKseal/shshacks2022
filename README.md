Thank you to stackOverflow for helping us with many problems we discovered along the way.

Thank you to this article for teaching us how to create a custom keyboard : https://www.androidauthority.com/lets-build-custom-keyboard-android-832362/

Thank you to the official FirebaseUI code snippet as well as library for helping us implement a robust authentication service : https://github.com/firebase/snippets-android/blob/7268f816496dac6990b9587874520daeeba46333/auth/app/src/main/java/com/google/firebase/quickstart/auth/FirebaseUIActivity.java#L49-L62

We hope to improve on this project much more but we feel we might have made it to complicated for us to finish. Regardless, we are extremely proud of trying new things, most notably the backend, and thank the sponsors as well as the organizers for this opportunity.
